# NRT-Miracle-Rover
UTRA Hacks 2023 project done by Team NRT. Function written in Arduino/C++.


This project involves the creation of an autonomous robot using Arduino, designed to navigate its environment and perform various tasks without human intervention. The robot is equipped with sensors, motors, and a microcontroller to enable it to sense and react to its surroundings.


# Components

 - Arduino Board: Arduino Uno Board
 - Motors: 2 servo motors
 - Sensors: one infared sensor one and ultrasonic distance sensor
 - Chassis: custom made chasis using the breadboard as a base
- Power Supply: one 9 Volt battery


# Features

- Obstacle Avoidance: The robot is programmed to detect obstacles using sensors and autonomously navigate around them. The ultrasonic sensor dectects objects
- Line Following: The ability to follow a predefined path using the infrared sensor.
  
# Hardware design
- Secamtic of the wriring of the  infared sensor.

- Secmatic of the wiring of the ultrasonic distance sensor.
